# Developing actors

Kepler allows to incorporate custom actors. These actors should be developed according to Kepler's guide lines. In order to contribute to the project one must develop actor based on templates provided by Kepler project. You can find description on how to start actor development at following page: [Hello World Actor](https://kepler-project.org/developers/teams/build/documentation/developing-a-hello-world-actor-using-the-kepler-build-system-and-eclipse).

In order to build Kepler from the sources it is necesary to checkout source code from SVN repository and compile it. All the steps required for compiling Kepler 2.5 can be found here: [Build System Instructions](https://kepler-project.org/developers/teams/build/documentation/the-new-build-system).

If you want to create actors that use indigoclient API for accessing Future Gateway's resources make sure to take a look here: [indigoclient](http://github.com/indigo-dc/indigoclient).
